Help within TYPO3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before we dive further into using TYPO3, I would like to make clear again that even though this
tutorial covers the basic features, there are a lot more. Here's where you can learn more
directly from within your website:

- A very short description of buttons or functions appears if you hover
  with your mouse pointer over it.

- A lot of times you will see the following **question mark** next to an element. Hovering over
  it will pop up a little help window about the item or function it is next to:

.. figure:: ../../Images/help_img1.png
   :alt: Figure 2

- For a more extensive description use the  **manual** module in the
  help category in the menu.
